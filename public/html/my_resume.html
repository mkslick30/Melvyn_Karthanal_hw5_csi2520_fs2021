        <h3>Professional experience</h3>
        <h4>October 4 - Present, Server, Fogo de Chao, Troy Michigan</h4>
        <p>My responsibilities include taking orders and serving dishes to customers. As they all rushed to the dining area for breakfast, lunch and dinner, a team of servers had created a formal dinner table setup for everyone attending. We would give them what they asked for and any other necessities required for their meals.</p>

        <h4>July 2019 - March 2020, Dasher(Delivery Driver), Doordash</h4>
        <p>As a delivery driver, I had to work on my patience and responsibility. Not only is driving a risky job, but it’s a daring way to make a few extra dollars from tips and base pay. There was a system where it alerted us drivers that there was a busy area to work in. These were the areas I mostly worked in because I was free to work when and where I pleased. Sometimes there was a downtime, which really tested my patience. Being a driver required me to stay safe and abide by the law, otherwise there would be a risk of getting into an accident.</p>

Also, I had to take and serve orders for the elderly citizens living in the building.
